Even thought I had a workable solution, after doing some more reading (primarily on big name 
developers websites) I noticed that a number of them were either using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org), 
[Moveable Type](http://www.moveabletype.org) or they were opting for simpler solutions.

I've always preferred "simple" to complex so I had a look at the solutions they were implementing. 
Some of them were really neat. The ones that attracted me were the sites that relied on a basic markup 
language and static webpages. I think it is the developer in me that drew me to these solutions. I used 
to enjoy hacking away code in emacs using scripts/macro languages/#defines/etc. to create nice tight chunks of code.

Keeping in mind I didn't want to spend months doing research I limited my analysis to two tools: 
[Nanok v3](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Both of these are Ruby 
solutions. I've been interested in learning Ruby so I thought I would have a look at these to see if 
they would teach me a thing or two.

After spending a few days playing with each and eventually settled on Jekyll. I've also started to 
use [Git](http://git-scm.com/), [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/), and [MacVim](http://macvim.org/). All very cool.

The basics of the site have been set up. Now I just need to use the *[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)* to make it look reasonable and I've got my platform.
