Sometimes it pays to get distracted by other things.

My previous iteration of this site relied on a base [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) install with a number of add-ons, extensions and hacks to add all of the functionality I wanted. Most of it was working when [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) version 2.0 was announced.

Octopress 2.0 addressed all of my needs (and the remaining issues) and provided the necessary information to quickly get a site up and running. A quick Google search for running Jekyll under [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) and I was able to get a working site up and running in no time.

Now I have a working [git](http://www.git-scm.com) repository, a synchronized [github](http://www.github.com) repository and a local copy managed through [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com). I like this solution as it is very easy to maintain (i.e., all I need to do is write articles, sync with git and then push it to heroku).  Any patches/changes coming out of Jekyll will be applied to Octopress and can easily be upgraded.

The only thing I would like to do, besides write in my blog, is change the default layout. Octopress has a nice layout etc. that works in most browsers (i.e., mobile, iPad and PC). The colour scheme etc. is a little dark for my liking. In the spirit of "shipping" I'm going to keep writing and modify the layout when I have time.
