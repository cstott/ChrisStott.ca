Work was stressful this week. To get my mind off of it I spent part of today playing around with Jekyll, 
HTML5 Boilerplate and Compass. It was very satisfying making a working system out of a number of tools 
I haven't really used before. I knew what I wanted and was able to make it happen.

Working on all of this makes me realize that there are lots of smart people on the web. The tools 
I'm using are well thought out and designed. With little more than a hacker attitude (i.e., curiosity, 
willingness to make mistakes, eagerness to learn, etc.) I've been able to quickly get up to speed and 
become productive using several tools.
