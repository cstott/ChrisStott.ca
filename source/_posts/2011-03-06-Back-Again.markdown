Well I'm back again. Ironically in the past when I've stopped blogging
in the past it was usually because I got distracted by some
technical / business. This time I have a valid reason.

This year I added a new team member to my team at work. The individual
who joined was quite keen and interested in personal productivity,
entreprenuerism, etc. I started off with my usual orientation including
directing him to links to things that would support his style.

After a month or so he asked me if I'd be interested in starting a blog
to capture these great articles. The result is [The Habit of Thinking](http://www.thehabitofthinking.com). 
He came up with the great name.

So far we've had 2 articles a day for the last month. Basically as I
read my usual information feeds, documents, books, etc. I keep an eye
out for things I think will be relevant. When I see it I add it to a
draft "queue". Harry then reviews and approves mine. It is pretty neat
as we've been able to keep a growing queue in place so there is usually
a week's worth of entries ready to go.

To be honest it has been a bit of a thrill. We got our first follower a
while a go and now we have 4. We are no A-list blogger but we are having
fun (and learning something along the way). All the things I've done to
set up the site improve my skills to work on my own.

I'll probably be referencing articles across the sites. This site will
contain my more detailed articles (i.e., long ones) and the other will
be more short snippets of information or links to longer articles.
