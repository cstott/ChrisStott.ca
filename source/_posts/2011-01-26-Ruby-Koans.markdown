To help me learn my current [blogging tool](http://www.jekyllrb.com) I have started to teach myself
Ruby.  Ironically it is the same way that I taught myself to program in C many years ago (20+). 
Back then the "Interwebs" were in their infancy and I wanted to learn C.  I didn't have a book 
so I searched around the system and found the "learnc" tutorial that was built in to Unix.
Basically I'd start it up, look at the examples, and then try to hack the code. I'd figured out 
how it was comparing my answer to the systems so I reverse engineered my way to an explanation. 
Worked wonders when I got stuck. In the end I was known as quite the C 'hacker' (something that I 
was called - not a label I gave myself).

Anyway back to the [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com). Basically you download them from the 
website, make sure you have a good editor (I'm really liking [MacVim](http://macvim.org/) and 
run the "rake" command. Through a Test Driven Development approach (i.e., Red, Green, Refactor) 
you basically work through a series of 274 tests. Each one builds on previous exercises. There 
are a couple of hard ones but thanks to google I've been able to look up syntax and guestimate what the
language is doing. There is enough there that you get a pretty good feel for the language. I'm 
in no way a Ruby ninja now but I feel I can read "good" Ruby code and get the general gist of what it is doing.

Lots of **fun**!
