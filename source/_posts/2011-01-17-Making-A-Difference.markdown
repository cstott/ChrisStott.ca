Following my attendance at the DemoCamp I’ve been thinking a lot about what I could offer a start up. 
I’m definitely interested in figuring out how I can help startups. Part of me wished that I was a kick-ass 
coder again but I'm starting to realize that given my almost 20 years of “learning” my bigger offering 
would be my business knowledge. I've read hundreds of business books, articles, etc. 

Unlike many who read this type of information I have spend most of my career trying to apply it. The 
information just just clicks with me. My challenge is that it has taken me all these years to realize 
that I'm probably better suited for an entrepreneurial venture than being a drone in a large organization. 

It is all about contribution.  As with most organizations the challenge is that if you don’t play the 
political games after a time everyone’s skills depreciates.  There might be individuals with much more 
to contribute but they are usually limited by what they are “allowed to do” - and that is limited by 
what their boss feels comfortable with.
