I remember starting the whole “I need a blog” thing. I spent <strike>days</strike>, <strike>no weeks</strike>, 
no months reading numerous HTML/CSS coding books with the hope of becoming a coding expert before I put anything 
“out there”. Of course that required full analysis of all the hosting options, languages (PHP, Perl, Ruby, etc.) 
before I could pick a tool. I’d have to pay for hosting and then spend a considerable amount of time developing my 
blog layout - all before I could add content.

Now look at me. Find URL - check. Look at hosting options - check. Curious about Tumblr and Posterious. Can they 
support personal URLs?? Test out with tumblr and BANG I’ve got a customized blog.

Damn, that was easy!
