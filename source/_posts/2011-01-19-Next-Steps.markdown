Over the last little while I've been reflecting what the next steps for
me would be. Some people are motivated to "survive" work so they can
enjoy their passion - usually something outside of the job. Others are
mindlessly working day after day just to make ends meet.

To me that isn't living. I'm driven to make a difference. I've been
asked why can't I just keep my head down and do a good "enough" job.
I've been told to enter an organization and "sit on my hands" so that I
didn't disturb anyone. WFT?

That's not making things better. That's not growth. If you are not
moving forward you are slowly dying - and that's the last thing I want
to do.

Over the years I've learned lots about effectively running
organizations. I've proven time and time again that I can deliver the
"_impossible projects_". The challenge I've had is that most companies
only have the endurance to conduct change like these (and usually it is
massive change) very infrequently. Once I've delivered the project they
don't know what to do with me.

**Note:** I belive that any impossible project is delivered by a team.
My skill, and gift, is the ability to get the best out of a team.
Ultimately my goal is to have them deliver successfully and at the end
of the day have them look back and say "look what we did!"

Are there organizations that are willing to leverage my skills? Do I
need to create an organization that is open to shifting and changing to
the market so that **we** can make a difference.
