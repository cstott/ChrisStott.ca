I discovered a really interesting site a few weeks ago. [P2PU](http://www.p2pu.org/) is looking to 
create an educational revolution. In their words:

> The Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is an online community of open study groups for short university-level courses.

Yesterday I went to our local [Agile Users Group](http://www.calgaryagile.com/) meeting. I try to 
get out when they have an interesting topic. Tonight it was on Ruby on Rails. It was just basic 
introduction to the language and but it gave me the kick in the butt to try one of the P2PU course.

I've applied for the "Introduction to Ruby and Rails" course. One of the requirements to apply was 
to write a chunk of code, in your language of choice, that reads in a sentence and then prints the 
words in the sentence in the opposite order. Basic stuff but it was a little challenging given I don't 
know Ruby. Thinking up a solution was easy given the trivial nature of the problem so I thought I'd 
give it a shot in Ruby using an introductory book provided in the install environment. Once I was 
done an hour later I looked at my code and it looked a lot like C - makes sense given that was my 
last development language.

In any case, whether I get in or not, I think I'm going to investigate Rails some more.
