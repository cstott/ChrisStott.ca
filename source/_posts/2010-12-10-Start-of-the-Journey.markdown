I’ve been in the tech business for almost 20 years. Over that time I have worked on just about all 
“sides” of the table. I’ve been a management consultant, an employee, an independent contractor, a 
consultant working for a <strike>pimping</strike> consulting agency. My specialty has primarily been 
in the technology area, however, I’ve been “accused” (not sure if that is a bad thing) of being a 
people geek, process geek, etc. Reality is I’m just a geek. 

Despite being rewarded well for all this work (for the most part) I’ve always been restless. I’m 
always looking for the next big challenge. Once I get a project, group, or department running smoothly 
I get bored. I start to look for the next challenge, even if that means improving upon the model we 
just put in place. I live for that but unfortunately not everyone is the same. Some suffer from change 
fatigue while others are just waiting for a quiet moment to climb back in to the status quo.

I guess I’ve become a “suit” - someone who is comfortable standing up in front a crowded room, taking
the lead and communicating the direction and vision of very large projects. But part of me is also a 
hacker. Not in the “black hat/grey hat/white hat” way but more of a curious person whose not afraid 
to take apart problems. The bugger the challenge the bigger the curiosity. I get sucked in by that 
curiosity until I resolve the problem.

I’ve started numerous blogs but I feel like this one is different. The purpose is to help me figure 
out the journey I’m on and figure out where I want to end up.
