Yesterday I went **way** outside of my usual box. A few weeks ago I found a local website that was 
advertising a local Demo Camp event for the Calgary area. I thought "What the heck?" so I made arrangements 
to head down and attend the meeting. Despite being a very strong **INTJ** I headed down.

I had a good time. I ran in to the lady who used to do the role I'm currently performing. She has 
really branched out and has developed a successful career as a leadership coach. We had a good chat 
catching up and then she gave me some tips on the meeting format, what was usually discussed and some 
other local meetings that might be interesting. Thanks for letting me tag along.

In talking with her and others there you could feel a real 'joy' around what people were working on. 
Some were small personal projects and others larger platform based initiatives. I still need to figure 
out how to introduce myself. Corporate IT guy comes across awkward when I'm talking to a 22 year-old 
entrepreneur who would probably rather work at McDonalds then do what I do. In any case, I feel I have 
skills I could offer them. Ah, the joys of <strike>age</strike> maturity.

I'm looking forward to the next time.
